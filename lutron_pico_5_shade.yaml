    name: Lutron Pico 5 Button - Shade Entity Control
    description: "This blueprint allows for the association of a Lutron Pico 5 Button (model PJ2-3BRL-GXX-X01) remote with one or more cover entities. It is designed to simulate the operation of a standard Lutron Caseta fan controller including the press and hold functionality for the raise/lower buttons. It allows for the assignment of any action to the middle button."
