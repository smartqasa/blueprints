  name: Lutron Pico 5 Button - Fan Entity Control
  description: >-
    Control one or more fans using a Lutron Pico 5 Button (model PJ2-3BRL-GXX-X01).
    This blueprint simulates a standard Lutron Caseta fan controller, including press-and-hold
    for the raise/lower buttons. Specify the number of speed settings the fan supports
    (4 or 6), and set the speed percentage for the "on" button. The blueprint also allows you to
    assign any action to the middle (favorite) button.
