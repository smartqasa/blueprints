  name: Lutron Pico 5 Button - Media Player Entity Control
  description: >-
    This blueprint allows for the association of a Lutron Pico 5 Button (model PJ2-3BRL-GXX-X01)
    remote with a light entity. It is designed to simulate the operation of a standard Lutron Caseta 
    wall dimmer including the press and hold functionality for the raise/lower buttons. It allows for 
    the control over the brightness step percentage and transition speed and the assignment of any 
    action to the middle button.
